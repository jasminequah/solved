The study of agriculture is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agricultural_science">agricultural science</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_agriculture">history of agriculture</a> dates back thousands of years; people gathered wild grains at least 105,000 years ago and began to plant them around 11,500 years ago before they became domesticated. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Crops originate from at least 11 regions of the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_agriculture">Industrial agriculture</a> based on large-scale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monoculture">monoculture</a> has in the past century come to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people worldwide still depend on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsistence_agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a>.</p>
